# ViewerStorm Browser
Welcome to the official page for the ViewerStorm Browser!

## Features
The browser is based on Chromium and features:
- Custom ViewerStorm look and feel;
- Responsive window;
- Automatic updates.

## Download
Download the latest version in the *Releases* section. 
You will only have to download the application from this section one time. Once you have installed the ViewerStorm Browser, it will keep itself up-to-date automatically!

## Coming Soonâ„¢
In no given order, here's a couple items we want to work on next:
- Mute button to mute (parts of) the application with;
- Popup windows in the same look of the main window (and with the same settings);
- Coil.com browser plugin integrated into the app;
- MacOS and Linux support.

## FAQ
### 1. I'm getting an _Unknown publisher_ warning when trying to run the file.
This is a known issue. Please allow the app to run, so you can enjoy the ViewerStorm Browser. Once you have accepted it, you will never get the prompt again.

First, click on _More info_ on the _Windows protected your PC_ popup. Then, click the _Run anyway_ button in the bottom right of the popup.

Certificates to avoid showing this screen are very expensive. As we are still in the early stages of this project, and those certificates _still_ need 100+ installs to work properly, we have currently not purchased one. 

### 2. Why should I use this app instead of using my preferred browser?
You're more than welcome to use your own browser instead of the ViewerStorm Browser. 

The reason why we built this application is that we got tired of browsers changing their settings all the time, causing issues with registering views and tokens. 

By building our own application, we have more control over what browser version we use and work out any issues with new browser versions. This way, the ViewerStorm experience can remain stable for as many people as possible. 

### 3. I would like to report an issue!
Awesome! Thank you for helping us improve the app. Please use the [ViewerStorm Discord](https://discord.com/invite/EbYrkTa) for your feedback.
